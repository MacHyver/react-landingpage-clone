              Daily Dishonesty
            </a>
            <p>
              In 2012, I started a lettering blog that chronicled all of the
              little white lies my friends and I told in college. Little did I
              know it would go viral and land me a book deal while I was still
              in school! This is the project that launched my lettering career &
              gave me the confidence to leave my full-time job to pursue
              freelance.

              Ex Boyfriend Tears
            </a>
            <p>
              A particular nasty break up inspired a line of cups and flasks
              called Ex Boyfriend Tears. I was originally only planning on
              producing about 50 for fun, but they got shared like crazy
              online...and I ended up selling over 600 of them. Nasty Gal (RIP)
              bought a wholesale order from me, and Urban Outfitters even ripped
              me off!

            </a>
            <p>
              I started bartering restaurant chalkboard menus for the exact menu
              items I lettered. Within 1 year, I had practiced lettering and
              eaten delicious free food at over 30 restaurants in New York City.
              Plus, I built my chalk lettering portfolio up and landed projects
              with Chobani, Samuel Adams, and Microsoft as a result.

              No Photos Please
            </a>
            <p>
              For all of 2016, I traveled and worked around the world. In order
              to spend less time looking at a screen, I challenged myself to
              document my trip in travel drawings. I lettered my way around the
              world and shared my drawings, not travel pics, on social media.
              The result? Improved drawing skills and tons of new followers!

              Flour Crowns
            </a>
            <p>
              I decided to take a pun way too far and put flours instead of
              flowers in my hair. Why? Mostly for fun, but also to become more
              associated with the food world because I knew I wanted to work on
              a cookbook in the future. This was a delicious baby step in that
              direction without distracting from my lettering career too much.

            Hello! My name is Lauren Hom, and I'm a designer & letterer who's
            used passion projects to shape her career (and teaches others how to
            do the same). In 2014, I left my 9-to-5 job in advertising to start
            my own creative studio, Hom Sweet Hom. Since then, I've designed for
            clients like Google, Starbucks, and TIME Magazine, and my work has
            been recognized by the Type Directors Club, Communication Arts, and
            the Webby Awards. My motto is, and always will be, "Work hard, snack
            often."
